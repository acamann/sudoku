# Sudoku App

This is a personal project to become more comfortable with React/Redux using TypeScript by building a Sudoku Generator & Solver.

Goals:
 - establish scalable folder structure
 - establish scalable frontend standards & rationale
 - understand the benefits and limits of scss over traditional css
 - practice writing React component tests
 - make a cool mobile-first sudoku app that displays a popover menu on cell click to do pencil marks
